## A PyTorch Model to Nothing to Detect Everything

### A Research About Everything Detection by Training to Nothing!

I start with an example: Think about the object detection models that have a list of objects in the datasetsâ€”for example, cats, dogs, and birds segmented into folders. We train the model to detect these categories. However, this is not ideal when we don't know what our model will be detecting. 

What if we need to detect things that don't exist in a predefined list? Our trained model cannot detect uncategorized or unknown objects, but a human can. We just show an image of an UFO to a human, and they will detect things similar to the image for us.

For this purpose, we should train our model to "nothing." There will not be a list of categories of objects like in YOLO models. Instead, there will be an object and images where this object exists. The user will then provide an image of the object they want to detect, and the model will detect the object from a camera or any image.

Our model will learn something deeper than just the shapes and corners of a known object, like a cat's body. It will be trained to more deeply understand and behave like a human.
it's in other say is an inclusion detection model.
